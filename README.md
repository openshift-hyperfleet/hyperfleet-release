### RC E2E Testing

[`RELEASE_MANIFEST.yaml`](./RELEASE_MANIFEST.yaml) records the component image versions and test-suite ref that make up a release candidate. Use [`scripts/trigger-rc-e2e.sh`](./scripts/trigger-rc-e2e.sh) to run the RC E2E test job against those images — see [`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).
